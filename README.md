# hello-world

I am following the "Hello World GitHub guide," and it is quite good. I think I will use it as one model for my students to learn technical writing.

This guide can accomplish a few things:
- Students need to learn what good technical writing looks like.
- Students need to have a platform for sharing that is better than, say, Google Docs.[^fn1]

[^fn1]: NOTE: I do not know if being an open-source only free thing will be a problem. Do I need to pay for an account for private classwork? Would github be willing to let us work on private respositories for free? Is FERPA an issue?

Also, the guide did not show how to do a diff when merging a pull request.

NOTE: GitHub does not do footnotes, apparently. LAME.
